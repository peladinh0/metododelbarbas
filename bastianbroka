"But 
I must explain to you how all this mistaken ide
 of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
 give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actua
l teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builde  of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleas
ure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not k
  now how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that a
re extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or p
ursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, bu
t because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain
can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except t
o obtain some advantage from
 it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses t
 o enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one wh
o avoids a pai
n that produces no resultant pleasure?"
